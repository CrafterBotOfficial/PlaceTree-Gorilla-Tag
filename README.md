## Usage

To use the mod go into a [MODDED GAMEMODE](https://github.com/legoandmars/Utilla#enabling-your-mod) instance. Then [HOLD](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hold) the [LEFT TRIGGER](https://scontent.fewr1-6.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/64523870_622041708297936_5486636097175814144_n.png?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=ad8a9d&_nc_ohc=ptwMaDUTAfcAX8f8FeZ&_nc_ht=scontent.fewr1-6.fna&oh=00_AfChgAzAPrImYMaruTQ8DAw79Z4Vn24ttJds1KhM9lXNlg&oe=64104C8A). This will show a dummy tree that will follow your hand forward position. Then aim your pointer finger where you want the tree to spawn. You can adjust the scale & rotation by using the [LEFT JOYSTICK](https://scontent.fewr1-6.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/64523870_622041708297936_5486636097175814144_n.png?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=ad8a9d&_nc_ohc=ptwMaDUTAfcAX8f8FeZ&_nc_ht=scontent.fewr1-6.fna&oh=00_AfChgAzAPrImYMaruTQ8DAw79Z4Vn24ttJds1KhM9lXNlg&oe=64104C8A). Up for scale up, Down for scale down. left for rotate left, right for rotate right. To delete all trees go into the HauntedModMenu and unselect 'Place Tree'. This will delete all spawned trees and deactivate the mod. Reselect it to continue using the mod.

## Notes

*KronoSeptic I spelled 'Haunted' correctly this time >:)
*This mod was written when I was tired so it is slightly disorganized.
*If I find this mod in any 'shitty' mod menus I will take action through Discord to have it removed.
